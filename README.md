# The-Chesster
A project where chess engine plays on behalf of the player.

## Introduction
The Chesster is a project where a chess engine plays on behalf of the player. The player can play against the engine, watch the engine play against another player, or watch the engine play against another engine. The engine uses the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to determine the best move. The engine also uses a basic evaluation function to evaluate the board state. The engine is written in Python and uses the python-chess library to represent the board state and move generation.

## Features (under development)
- Play against the engine (human vs. engine)
- Watch the engine play against another player (engine vs. human)
- Watch the engine play against another engine (engine vs. engine)
- Undo moves
- Change the engine's search depth
- Change the engine's evaluation function
- Change the engine's move ordering
- Change the engine's time limit
- Change the engine's opening book

## Limitations
- The project is still a work in progress.
- The project cannot take proper screenshots of the board if the resolution scale is more than 100%.
